LINDA (Linear Integer programming for Network reconstruction using transcriptomics and Differential splicing data Analysis) as a method that integrates resources of protein-protein and domain-domain interaction, transcription factor targets and differential splicing/transcript analysis to infer splicing-dependent effects on cellular pathways and regulatory networks.

LINDA is being maintained and further developed by [DieterichLab](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/). For more details you can check it's dedicated [Github page](https://dieterich-lab.github.io/LINDA/).
