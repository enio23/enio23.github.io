[TACOMA](https://shiny.dieterichlab.org/app/tacoma), as a user-friendly resource to explore and visualize multi-omics time-course data of hypertrophy progression from a Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) mouse model. Consequently, [TACOMA](https://shiny.dieterichlab.org/app/tacoma) offers the potential to uncover molecular mechanisms associated with hypertrophies and heart failure, which are crucial for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes.

LINDA is being maintained and further developed by [DieterichLab](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/). TACOMA has been implemente as a Shiny-App and it can be accessed online [here](https://shiny.dieterichlab.org/app/tacoma).
