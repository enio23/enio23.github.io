LINDA+ is a method that integrates large-scale protein and domain interaction data single-cell RNA/Protein data to map and study intra- and inter-cellular interaction networks at domain resolution, particularly regarding the effects of alternative splicing on signaling.
LINDA+ is being maintained and further developed by [DieterichLab](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/). For more details you can check on the dedicated [Github page](https://enio23.github.io/lindaplus-docs/).
