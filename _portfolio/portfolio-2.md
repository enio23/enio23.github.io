CellNOpt (CellNetOptimiser) is a framework to build predictive logic models of signalling pathways by training a prior knowledge network (PKN) to biochemical data obtained from perturbation experiments. The CellNOpt R packages feature different formalisms ranging from Boolean logic to logic-based ordinary differential equation and they are also available in Bioconductor. LINDA is being maintained by [saezlab](https://github.com/saezlab).
