CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) integrates different sources of prior knowledge including signed and directed proteinâ€“protein interactions, transcription factor targets, and pathway signatures. The use of prior knowledge in CARNIVAL enables capturing a broad set of upstream cellular processes and regulators, leading to a higher accuracy when benchmarked against related tools.

CARNIVAL is being maintained and further developed by [saezlab](https://github.com/saezlab). For more details you can check on [this publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-019-0118-z) as well as it's dedicated [Github page](https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/).
