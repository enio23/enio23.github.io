The LINDA framework, while capable of modeling protein interaction networks and protein domain changes, is limited by incomplete and biased data resources, its inability to model all types of alternative splicing, and issues with identifying a single most likely signaling mechanism, which a new framework called ALL-LINDA proposes to address by integrating Large Language Models and AlphaFold3 to update knowledge, validate protein interactions, and improve identifiability.
ALL-LINDA is currently under development. For some initial more details you can check on the dedicated [documentation page](https://enio23.github.io/lindaplus-docs/ailinda/). More details will arrive soon.
