PHONEMeS (PHOsphorylation NEtworks for Mass Spectrometry), is a method that is used to train and build large-scale Boolean logic models of signaling. PHONEMeS combines identified phosphopeptide abundance measurements (e.g., from untargeted shotgun phosphoproteomic experiments) with a large Prior Knowledge Network (PKN). The PKN is primarily built from known kinase/phosphatase-to-substrate (K/Pâ€“S) relations. 

PHONEMeS is being maintained and further developed by [saezlab](https://github.com/saezlab).
