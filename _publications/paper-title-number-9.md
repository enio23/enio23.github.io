collection: publications
excerpt: 'Here we present a time-course multi-omics dataset from a mouse model of heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC), analyzed using transcriptomics and proteomics to uncover molecular mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction. The data are integrated into TACOMA, a web application enabling interactive exploration of gene and protein expression, alternative splicing, and biological pathway enrichment across disease progression.'

Time-course multi-omics data of a murine model of progressive heart failure (HF) 
induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) provide insights into the molecular 
mechanisms that are causatively involved in contractile failure and structural 
cardiac remodelling. We employ Illumina-based transcriptomics, Nanopore sequencing 
and mass spectrometry-based proteomics on samples from the left ventricle (LV) and 
right ventricle (RV, RNA only) of the heart at 1, 7, 21 and 56â€‰days following TAC 
and Sham surgery. Here, we present Transverse Aortic COnstriction Multi-omics Analysis 
(TACOMA), as an interactive web application that integrates and visualizes 
transcriptomics and proteomics data collected in a TAC time-course experiment. 
TACOMA enables users to visualize the expression profile of known and novel genes 
and protein products thereof. Importantly, we capture alternative splicing events 
by assessing differential transcript and exon usage as well. Co-expression-based 
clustering algorithms and functional enrichment analysis revealed overrepresented 
annotations of biological processes and molecular functions at the protein and 
gene levels. To enhance data integration, TACOMA synchronizes transcriptomics and 
proteomics profiles, enabling cross-omics comparisons. With [TACOMA](https://shiny.dieterichlab.org/app/tacoma), 
we offer a rich web-based resource to uncover molecular events and biological 
processes implicated in contractile failure and cardiac hypertrophy.
