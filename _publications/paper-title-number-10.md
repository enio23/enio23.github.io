title: "Reading papers: Extraction of molecular interaction networks with large language models"
collection: preprint
excerpt: 'This study explores the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) for extracting molecular interaction data, specifically protein-protein and bene regulatory relations from scientific literature. The approach shows promising accuracy in relation extraction and offers a toolset for automating biological network curation.'

In this work, we use open-source LLMs to mine an annotated corpus of molecular 
interactions. We focus on the extraction of entity relations between proteins, 
as exemplified in protein-protein interaction networks, and transcription factor 
to target gene relations, as exemplified in gene regulatory networks.
