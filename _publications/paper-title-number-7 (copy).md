Nanopore long-read sequencing enables real-time monitoring and controlling of individual nanopores. This allows us to enrich or deplete specific sequences in DNA sequencing in a process called “adaptive sampling.” So far, adaptive sampling (AS) was not applicable to the direct sequencing of RNA. Here, we show that AS is feasible and useful for direct RNA sequencing (DRS), which has its specific technical and biological challenges. Using a well-controlled in vitro transcript-based model system, we identify essential characteristics and parameter settings for AS in DRS, as the superior performance of depletion over enrichment. Here, the efficiency of depletion is close to the theoretical maximum. Additionally, we demonstrate that AS efficiently depletes specific transcripts in transcriptome-wide sequencing applications. Specifically, we applied our AS approach to poly(A)-enriched RNA samples from human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes and mouse whole heart tissue and show efficient 2.5- to 2.8-fold depletion of highly abundant mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Finally, we characterize depletion and enrichment performance for complex transcriptome subsets, that is, at the level of the entire Chromosome 11, proving the general applicability of direct RNA AS. Our analyses provide evidence that AS is especially useful to enable the detection of lowly expressed transcripts and reduce the sequencing of highly abundant disturbing transcripts.
