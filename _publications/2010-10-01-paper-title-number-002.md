A comprehensive logic model of endothelin signalling was constructed using phosphoproteomics data from melanoma cell lines, highlighting the role of specific kinases in Endothelin (EDN)-induced cell migration and supporting the strategic selection of kinase inhibitors for combined treatments with EDN receptor antagonists.
