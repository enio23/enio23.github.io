Course for the [Medical Informatics](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/all-subjects/medical-informatics/medical-informatics-master) (Profile Bioinformatics). 2022, 2023. In this course I describe the fundamental principles for doing mathematical modelling of Biological System.

Course Content
======
The course covered the following aspects:
**i)** Definition of a Biological System.
**ii)** Elements that are needed for mathematical modelling of biological systems.
**iii)** Two examples of modelling of a bacterial metabolic system system with linear and non-linear programming.
**iv)** Global optimization techniques.
**v)** Model evaluation.
