Teaching for the Heidelberg Biosciences International Graduate School ([HBIGS](https://www.hbigs.uni-heidelberg.de/)). The course focused on the presenting step-by-step analysis of Proteomics data as well as the integrative analysis of Proteomics and Transcriptomics. The lecture was organized over an the _EGF-driven protein synthesis case-study_ date from [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6249402/).

Proteomics Analysis
======
Ste-bystep tutorials of analysis from raw proteomics data to differential protein analysis:
**i)** Data preparation (reformatting of the raw peptide data, QC, dealing with duplicated peptides, etc.).
**ii)** Data filtering.
**iii)** Data transformation/normalization.
**iv)** Data imputation techniques.
**v)** Dimensionality reduction/PCA analysis for interpretation of samples.
**vi)** Identification and removal of bathc effects.
**vii)** Differential analysis of data.

Integrative Analysis
======
Step-by-step tutorials for integrative analysis of proteomics & transcriptomics data. This part focused on covering the following aspects:
**i)** Data preparation and pre-processing.
**ii)** Correlation analysis.
**iii)** Data clustering.
**iv)** Pathway analysis.
**v)** Identification of functional protein interaction modules.
