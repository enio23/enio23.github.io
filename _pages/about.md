Hello, this is Enio! 

I am a postdoctoral scientist working with [Christoph Dieterich](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/en/zentrum-fuer-innere-medizin-medizin-klinik/innere-medizin-iii-kardiologie-angiologie-und-pneumologie/forschung/forschung/klaus-tschira-institut-fuer-computational-cardiology) at the Klaus Tschira Institute for Integrative Computational Cardiology and Department of Internal Medicine III (Cardiology, Angiology, and Pneumology), Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany. I have a background in Electronic and Biomedical Engineering and I have finished PhD in RWTH Aachen and Heidelberg University under the supervision of [Julio Saez-Rodriguez](https://saezlab.org/).

A complex world needs models. Models are methods used to simplify complex system. If we consider a system as a group of objects whose properties we want to study, then the best model is the simplest one which allows us to make accurate predictions when changing one of itâ€™s parameters or state of an object. Biological systems especially, are very complex and thus even considering the last advancements in computational technology; we need to develop new tools and methods to deal with such complexity. In my research, I am interested in tackling such problems by applying systems engineering principles and statistical methods to multi-omics data in order to gain insights into the mechanisms of molecular interactions and how they are affected in diseases. For this, I focus on developing computational tools to analyze and integrate different types of molecular data giving insight not only to the functional understanding of cellular networks but also to how they can help on the development of the new drugs and treatment strategies. The tools and methods I develop are mainly available in [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
