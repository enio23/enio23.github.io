Work experience
======
**SYMBIOSYS ITN Early Stage Researcher/PhD Candidate** – RWTH Aachen - Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (*08/2016-04/2020*)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Julio Saez-Rodriguez.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Thesis Title:** Identification of both structure and parameters of large signalling models. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the PhD project consists of modelling cell signalling networks for the purpose of understanding processes involved in it and the mechanisms of cell function. In particular, the modelling of signalling networks involved the integration of optimization techniques with simulation analysis in order to provide information about the behaviour of the biological system representing our signalling networks and predict certain outcomes as a result of perturbing specific components of our system (i.e. treating cells with drugs). Design, especially optimization-based is a major focus of my PhD studies, preceded by statistical and data exploration analysis (mainly of proteomics and transcriptomics data).


**SYMBIOSYS ITN Early Stage Researcher/PhD Candidate** – Heidelberg University - Institute for Computational Biomedicine, BioQuant Zentrum (*09/2018-04/2020*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From September 2018 continued my PhD project as a visiting researcher in BioQuant Zentrum at Heidelberg University.



Education
======
**BSc. in Electronic Engineering** - Polytechnic University of Tirana, Albania (*09/2009-08/2012*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Bsc. graduated in Electronic Engineering I obtained the skills of designing, conceive applications of data processing systems and maintaining electronic systems and sensor networks, database management, etc.. This background allows me to lead information processing laboratories of enterprises and companies in the area of industrial production, in medicine or in the environment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Thesis title:** Data Network Simulation and DDoS Attack against it.


**MSc. in Electronic Engineering (Clinical Profile)** - Polytechnic University of Tirana, Albania (*09/2012-08/2014*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Msc. graduated in Electronic Engineering/Clinical Profile I obtained the skills necessary to be employed in the area of data processing in sanitary and biomedical systems and electronic systems. As the Master program was still mainly based on the subjects related to electronics, as a graduate I could have still been employed in industries that handle automation and robotic; companies that work in informative systems and sensor networks as well as in services sector companies and in the public administration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Thesis title:** Retinal Tears Detection based on Image Processing with MATLAB.


**CEMACUBE Erasmus Mundus MSc. in Biomedical Engineering** - Ghent University and VU Brussels, Belgium (*1st year 09/2014-09/2015*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished the first year of the Master in Biomedical Engineering at Ghent University & Free University of Brussels (VUB) where I obtained a vast set of general knowledge regarding this field. The main subjects of the first year were Modelling of Physiological Systems, BiomedicalImaging, Medical Physics, Biomaterials, Biomechanics.


**CEMACUBE Erasmus Mundus MSc. in Biomedical Engineering** - RWTH Aachen, Germany (*2nd year 10/2015-08/2016*)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second year of the program, I specialised in Medical Imaging where I to deepened my knowledge of Medical Imaging Instrumentations and Image Processing Techniques. The main subjects include Image Processing and Management and Image-Guided Therapy/Molecular Imaging. The second semester I mainly worked on my thesis I had the first introduction to various optimisation techniques, applied statistics and image/data processing methods.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Thesis title:** Registration of 3D ultrasound volume images and segmentation of bone surfaces using statistical shape models.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the CEMACUBE Erasmus Mundus program, I obtained a joint Msc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Ghent University, VU Brussels and RWTH Aachen University.
